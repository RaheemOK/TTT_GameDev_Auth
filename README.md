## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

This project aims to provision resources in Google Cloud using Terraform and automate the deployment process through GitHub Actions. It utilizes Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles for managing cloud infrastructure.

### Purpose and Scope

The primary purpose of this project is to automate the provisioning of resources such as Google Compute Engine instances and Google Artifact Registry repositories in a Google Cloud environment. The scope includes defining infrastructure configurations and deploying them reliably.

### Key Features

- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated deployments.
- Use of Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code tool.
- Secure handling of sensitive data using GitHub Secrets.
- Infrastructure documentation and best practices.

## 2. Repository Structure

### Directory Structure

/
|-- .github/
| |-- workflows/
| | |-- provisioning.yml # GitHub Actions workflow
|
|-- modules/
| |-- ... # Terraform modules (if used)
|
|-- main.tf # Main Terraform configuration
|-- variables.tf # Input variables
|-- outputs.tf # Output variables
|-- terraform.tfvars # Variable values (not committed)
|-- README.md # Project documentation
|-- ... # Other project files



### Code Organization

- `main.tf`: Contains the primary Terraform configuration for provisioning resources.
- `variables.tf`: Defines input variables and their descriptions.
- `outputs.tf`: Specifies the output variables.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Stores variable values (should not be committed).
- `.github/workflows/provisioning.yml`: Defines the GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
- `modules/`: Directory for Terraform modules (if used).

---

## 3. Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with your Terraform code.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and project.
- GitHub Actions enabled in the repository.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. `GCP_CREDENTIALS`: Base64-encoded GCP service account credentials JSON.
2. `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID.
3. `GCP_REGION`: The target region for resources.
4. `GCP_ZONE`: The desired zone for resources.
5. `ARTIFACT_REPO_NAME`: Name of the Google Artifact Registry repository.

### Local Development Environment

For local development, install Terraform and authenticate your GCP account using `gcloud`. Ensure your local environment variables match the GitHub Secrets.

---

## 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

### Workflow Description

The GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of provisioning resources using Terraform. It consists of the following steps:

1. Checkout the repository.
2. Set up Terraform and decode GCP credentials.
3. Initialize Terraform.
4. Apply Terraform configurations to create or update resources.

### Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered manually using GitHub Actions workflow dispatch.

### Environment Variables

- `GCP_CREDENTIALS`: Encoded GCP service account credentials.
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: GCP project ID.
- `GCP_REGION`: Target region.
- `GCP_ZONE`: Target zone.
- `ARTIFACT_REPO_NAME`: Artifact Registry repository name.

### Terraform Initialization and Deployment

Terraform is initialized and applied within the GitHub Actions workflow, using the provided environment variables for configuration.

---

## 5. Terraform Configuration

### Resource Overview

The Terraform configuration provisions the following resources:

- Google Compute Engine instance.
- Google Artifact Registry repository.
- Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- Service accounts and access controls.

### Variables and Input Parameters

- `project`: GCP project ID.
- `region`: Target region.
- `zone`: Target zone.
- `repository_id`: Artifact Registry repository name.

Ensure that the variables in `terraform.tfvars` match your intended configuration.

### State Management

Terraform state is managed using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the backend. This ensures secure state storage and locking.

### Resource Dependencies

Terraform automatically manages resource dependencies based on declarations, but explicit dependencies are documented when necessary.

---

## 6. Best Practices and Recommendations

### Code Documentation

- Use comments to describe the purpose of each resource and module.
- Document the GitHub Actions workflow, explaining each step.
- Explain the use of variables and their significance.
- Describe resource dependencies and ordering.

### Resource Naming Conventions

- Follow consistent resource naming conventions for clarity.
- Prefix resources with identifiers (e.g., "gce_" for Google Compute Engine).

### Error Handling

- Implement error handling and logging in the GitHub Actions workflow.
- Document debugging strategies for Terraform issues.

### Secrets Management

- Document the handling and rotation of secrets.
- Ensure that secrets are securely stored and managed.

### Testing and Validation

- Consider implementing tests for your infrastructure code.
- Validate configurations using `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` locally and in CI/CD.

---

## 7. Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- Securely manage service account credentials.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization for Google Cloud resources.

### Access Controls

- Document the access controls for resources.
- Ensure least privilege principles are followed.

### Compliance Requirements

- Document any compliance or regulatory requirements that apply to your infrastructure.

---

## 8. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Upgrading Terraform Versions

- Document how to upgrade Terraform versions and handle potential compatibility issues.

### Debugging Tips

- Provide guidance on debugging common issues with Terraform deployments.

### Common Issues and Solutions

- Document solutions to common problems encountered during deployments.
